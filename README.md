# Track-Trawler
This project is aimed at using data analytics and mathematical techniques such as FFT to explore music. There are 3 main fucntion ideas currently under construction. 
The first one pulls song recommendations from Spotify based on a playlist or more descriptive parameters (mood, similar artist, similar song, key, instruments) as an input. 
The second one works as a track decomposer that returns a comprehensive track description including features such as associated moods, associated genres, keys, artist, producer, tempo, ...
The third one returns the listener's affinity to certain musical features based on Spotify listening history.
